# Python-Numpy-and-pandas-Assignment_7

This repository contains exercises focused on using NumPy and Pandas, two essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

NumPy is a powerful library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Pandas is built on top of NumPy and offers data structures and functions specifically designed to work with structured data. It provides DataFrame and Series objects, making it easy to manipulate and analyze data in Python.
